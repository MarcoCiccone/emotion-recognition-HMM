# emotion-recognition-HMM
This is my NLP project: emotion recognition using Hidden Markov Models

# How to use it
* It requires NLTK library for the HMM model  
* It requires Orange library for the data manipulation of the classes  
* Extract the features and POS files in order to use the script  
* I don't know if I can share the original dataset files because they are provided by my professor  
* If you need the original files send me an email to <marco.ciccone@mail.polimi.it> and I will let you know.
